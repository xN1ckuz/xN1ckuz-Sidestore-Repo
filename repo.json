            "localizedDescription": "Eevee Spotify\nThis tweak makes Spotify think you have a Premium subscription, granting free listening, just like Spotilife, and provides some additional features like custom lyrics.\nRestrictions\n• Very High audio quality\n• Native playlist downloading (you can download podcast episodes though)\n• Jam (hosting a Spotify Jam and joining it remotely requires Premium; only joining in-person works)\n• AI DJ/Playlist\n• Spotify Connect (When using Spotify Connect, the device will act as a remote control and stream directly to the connected device. This is a server-sided limitation and is beyond the control of EeveeSpotify, so it will behave as if you have a Free subscription while using this feature.)\nLyrics Support\nEeveeSpotify replaces Spotify monthly limited lyrics with one of the following four lyrics providers:\n• Genius: Offers the best quality lyrics, provides the most songs, and updates lyrics the fastest. Does not and will never be time-synced.\n• LRCLIB: The most open service, offering time-synced lyrics. However, it lacks lyrics for many songs.\n• Musixmatch: The service Spotify uses. Provides time-synced lyrics for many songs, but you'll need a user token to use this source. To obtain the token, download Musixmatch from the App Store, sign up, then go to Settings > Get help > Copy debug info, and paste it into EeveeSpotify alert. You can also extract the token using MITM.\n• PetitLyrics: Offers plenty of time-synced Japanese and some international lyrics.\nIf the tweak is unable to find a song or process the lyrics, you'll see a \"Couldn't load the lyrics for this song\" message. The lyrics might be wrong for some songs when using Genius due to how the tweak searches songs. While I've made it work in most cases, kindly refrain from opening issues about it.",
